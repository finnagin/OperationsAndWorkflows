name: overlay predict drug treats disease
description: predict_drug_treats_disease utilizes a machine learning model (trained on KP ARAX/KG1) to assign a probability that a given drug/chemical_substance treats a disease/phenotypic feature. For more information about how this model was trained and how it performs, please see (this publication)[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/765305v2]. The drug-disease treatment prediction probability is included as an edge attribute (with the attribute name "probability_treats") . You have the choice of applying this to all appropriate edges in the knowledge graph, or only between specified subject/object qnode id's (make sure one is a chemical_substance, and the other is a disease or phenotypic_feature). If the later, virtual edges are added with the relation specified by "virtual_edge_type" and the type "probably_treats".
